# Battleship-
In this project, we will build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship! 
In this version of the game, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. 
The player will have 4 guesses to guess the computer location of ship and hence sink the ship and WIN!
